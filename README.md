Author - Nanditha Lekshmy

Description: Exploratory data analysis of technology usage and lifestyle factors to understand their relationship with stress levels and overall well-being.
## Project Overview

This project analyzes lifestyle and technology-use data to explore how digital habits influence people’s stress and wellness. The dataset includes variables related to device usage, sleep, physical activity, diet, and mental health indicators.

The project addresses the following research question:

How does technology use affect stress levels and overall well-being?

The analysis demonstrates core data analytics and programming skills, including data import, custom statistical computation without major built-in functions, exploratory analysis of quantitative variables, and structured reporting of results. Outputs are written both to the console and to a user-specified text file.

## Data

Source: Tech_Use_Stress_Wellness.csv (Kaggle dataset)
Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nagpalprabhavalkar/tech-use-and-stress-wellness

This dataset is suitable for practicing statistical analysis, data interpretation, and wellness-oriented insights related to digital behaviour.

## Program Functionality

The program:

\* Imports data from CSV using Pandas

\* Performs analysis on quantitative variables

\* Implements eight custom analysis functions (without relying on major built-in statistical functions)

\* Examines relationships between technology use and wellness indicators

\* Prints results to the console and a user-specified text output file

## Dependencies

\* Python 3.x

\* pandas

## Running the Program

\* Download the following files:

     Midterm_Colab_Lekshmy_Nanditha.py
